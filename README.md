# Overview
The purpose of analyzing the temperature data from June and December in Oahu is to determine whether or not a surf and ice cream shop would be sustainable year-round due to the weather conditions.

# Results
The temperature data for June and December were tabulated during this project. The statistical analysis for each month is depicted below.

The key differences between these two months are:
* bullet 1
* bullet 2
* bullet 3

# Summary
Overall, we can determine that a surf and ice cream shop could be sustainable year-round after evaluating the temperature data for June and December. To be certain, the precipitation data was also evaluated for the two months. The precipitation statistcal analysis for the two months is depicted below.

We also pulled the temperature data for a month in Q1 and Q3 (as June and December are of Q2 and Q4 respectively) and was able to determine more definitively that Oahu remains fairly consistent throughout the year weather-wise. This allows us to conclude that the surf and ice cream shop is sustainable year-round.
